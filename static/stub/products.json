        "description": "Premium shock absorber for superior endurance in all conditions. FOAM CELL TECHNOLOGY - Micro-Cellular closed cell foam insert maximises cooling efficiency by occupying less internal space than gas within a pressurised shock absorber. Greater oil capacity and more surface area maintains lower operating temperatures. 40-45mm TEFLON BANDED PISTON - Precision shim-stack piston specifically valved by Ironman suspension engineers, banded with teflon for smooth long life operation. 65-72mm TWIN TUBE BODY - 50%-100% more oil volume than a gas shock absorber for superior cooling and endurance. Twin tube construction protects internal components from rock damage. 20mm HARD CHROME PISTON ROD - Hardened and polished, volumetrically balanced to piston size. FLEXIBLE RUBBER BUSHES - Offers quieter operation and reduces damaging side loads from shock absorber.",
